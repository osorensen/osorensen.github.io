I am a Professor of Statistics in the Department of Psychology at the University of Oslo, Norway. I am interested in latent variable models for analysis of longitudinal data in psychology, particularly on developing efficient computational algorithms and software. I also work on interpretable machine learning methods, and through various collaborations I am involved in a range of applied projects in psychology and neuroscience.
