I am a Professor of Statistics in the <a href="https://www.sv.uio.no/psi/english/index.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">Department of Psychology</a> at the University of Oslo, Norway. I am interested in latent variable models for analysis of longitudinal data in psychology, particularly on developing efficient computational algorithms and software. I also work on interpretable machine learning methods, and through various collaborations I am involved in a range of applied projects in psychology and neuroscience.
