I am involved with teaching of the following courses at the Department of Psychology, University of Oslo:

- [PSY2014 -- Kvantitativ metode](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/sv/psykologi/PSY2014/) (in Norwegian)
- [PSYC3103 -- Kvantitativ metode B](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/sv/psykologi/PSYC3103/index.html) (in Norwegian)
- [PSY9511 -- Machine learning](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/sv/psykologi/PSY9511/index.html)

I also occasionally give courses or talks (in English or Norwegian) on topics related to statistics or machine learning. During the last few years, I have given full-day courses in machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and R programming. Please send me an [e-mail](mailto:oystein.sorensen@psykologi.uio.no).
